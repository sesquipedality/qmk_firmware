# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

This is the sesquipedality fork of sonix_qmk.  Modifications are made to the "sn32" branch.

This is a custom build for the Rev3 GMMK1 iso full size board, with the following changes

1) Bug fix: use correct LED layout for full size ISO board
2) Bug fix: Update quantum/quantum_keycodes.h from the sn32_master so that RGB_ codes are correct
3) Enable mousekeys
4) Replace the scroll lock light so that it comes on when layer 2 is active.   I use layer for mousekeys on the numpad using VIA.

This firmware does not have hybrid OpenRGB support.  I'm not hugely fussed, and didn't like the modal VIA that the hybrid firmware uses.

To make

    make gmmk/full/rev3:via

I have forced ISO layout so that lighting would be correct in VIA builds.  This is not the right way to do this.  I do not knwo the right way.
For ANSI builds, just remove the relevant #define from keyboards/gmmk/full/config_led.h/config.h.
